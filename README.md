# The Bin! Which Bin?
You're visiting a friend, or perhaps in your own house, seeking harmony and consistency regarding your waste reduction plan. The planet is littered enough, and we can't keep destroying landscapes to create new landfills. So what's the best use of this otherwise-would-be-waste product?

# Add information about your bins
This app features the ability to add a new method for waste in your household. When you want to collect certain items (whether to reuse, use for crafts, burn, put in the garden, or recycle), just press the + button to enter a new bin that will appear in your list!

# Read the rules for each existing bin
Clicking any of the bins on the side will tell you about what goes in it, where to find it, and how to keep the bin happy.
